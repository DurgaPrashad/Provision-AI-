## Architecture
Provision AI follows a microservices architecture built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with TypeScript for type safety. Each component operates independently but communicates through well-defined APIs. This ensures:

- **Scalability:** Components can scale independently based on demand
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript provides better code quality and developer experience
- **Flexibility:** New features can be added without disrupting existing functionality
- **Maintainability:** Services can be updated or replaced individually
- **Resilience:** Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system

## API Documentation
Each service exposes its own API:

- ATS Resume Generator: GraphQL endpoint at `/api/resume-generator`
- PortZen Portfolio Builder: REST API at `/api/portfolio`
- Resume Feedback System: WebSocket connection at `/api/feedback`
- Profile Matching Engine: REST API at `/api/matching`

Detailed API documentation is available in the `/docs` directory.
